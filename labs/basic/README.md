# Introduction to C/C++ and using CMake to build projects

Hello, this is a simple project that uses CMake to build executables. The 
intended purpose of this is to help you become acustomed to C++ and how
to build libraries and executables. 

## You will need

For this lab your laptop will need to install several packages. How you 
install can be a lab in of itself (using autoconf, building, deploying).

These packages will be required:

  * A C/C++ compiler (gcc, clang). While xcode (MAC OSX) is needed 
    to bootstrap building, please try to use gcc or clang.
  * CMake. A build tool similar to imake, and maven.
  * An editor (IDE for C++, Atom, vim, nano, etc)

## Where to go from here

Well, there are a lot of topics to jump from this introduction that will
be discussed in class. Working on the C/C++ will help you be prepared 
when we start. Some suggestions on what to work on:

   * Adding Boost headers and/or libraries
   * Building a library and linking it into another project (code)
   * Clang's static analyzer (checker)
   * Exploring newest features (20, 17, 14, 11), it takes awhile for 
     standards to be implemented so, not all features are available. 

     ** Move semantics
     ** Lambda support
     ** loops, templates, namespaces, etc
