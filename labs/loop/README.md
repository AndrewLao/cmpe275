Loop collisions
===============

This lab looks a collisions across array boundaries when threading. The boundaries are
overlaping because of the n, n+1, and n-1 indexing.

Note: We will see this code again in our binding lab. 

# Build

Use the script build.sh to build a non-threaded, gnu and clang
implementations. 

If you are using Linux, comment out the xcode implementation

# Run

Run multiple times. Note the varying of collisions; why?
